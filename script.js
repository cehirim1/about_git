/*basic git commands 

git is a fancy term for tracking changes
enables you to take snapshots and save points by making a commit - commit creates a save point


- we need a special folder to put snapshots - create using git init (hidden repository, .git)
- to see all folders including hidden - ls -la
- git add - gathers all folders that we need to a staging area. we can individual file or *.html (all html extensions) . adds everything including the hidden folder
- git commit - saves a snapshot of everything that is in staging into the hidden file
- git :wq used to save and exit text editor if you accidentally commit without message
- branch code to experiment so as not to bork all your code
- git status to see the branch you're on 
- git branch <branch name> to create new branch
- git checkout <branch name> to go to new branch
- branches can be used to test new features and can be gotten rid of if you don't like or merge if you do
    like the changes - on the master/main merge the branch 
- all the git files are local
- to push to cloud or github: 


    GITHUB - remote/cloud backup of our local git repositories
- cool backup in the cloud
- has many tools that make it easier to work with developers
