/*basic git commands 

git is a fancy term for tracking changes
enables you to take snapshots and save points by making a commit - commit creates a save point


- we need a special folder to put snapshots - create using git init (hidden repository, .git)
- to see all folders including hidden - ls -la
- git add - gathers all folders that we need to a staging area. we can individual file or *.html (all html extensions) . adds everything including the hidden folder
- git commit - saves a snapshot of everything that is in staging into the hidden file
